To build a ci/cd workflow to automate a java project with production and staging environment
We will have to create 3 jobs e.g
1 - packagae_app - to build a artifact
2 - Deploy_tomcat_staging 
3 - Deploy_tomcat_production

1 - IN packagae_app - add a description
select discard builds add 5 and 5
In SCM use repo url and branch whatever you want to build from
In poll scm schedule it for every minute
in build environment choose delete wordkspacebefore build and timestamp
BUild sectiom Archive the artifacts and choose **/*.war
Build other projects - to Deploy_tomcat_staging

--------
Create new job with staging
In build step add copy artifcats from other project and use package_app name
copy **/*.war 
In post build  add a project with manual step
Deploy_tomcat_production
